Of the provided DevOps Certification courses available from our resources, the ones that seem the most interesting is:

1. Continuous Delivery & DevOps
 This one is the longest of those selected, but it is more extensive and comes with a certificate produced by the work. I would consider this to be the one with the most indepth look at lean architecture.

2. DevOps Culture and Mindset
 This set reinforces the first course as a way to ensure retention. Combined with the later and shorter courses, it should provide a good system-agnostic overview of how the DevOps philosophy works in action.

6. Getting Started with DevOps on AWS
 This one is super simple and designed to be done through a day, which makes it a great first pick just to understand the basics of DevOps management.

10. DevOps -- The Introduction Course
 Like 1 and 2, 6 and 10 will reinforce each other as similar, briefer courses.
